# Info

This is a little chrome extension which disables XScreensaver while youtube is in full-screen mode.
It uses a native messaging host, so some additional manual installation is necesarry.

# Installation (Linux)

1. Get the extension
2. Download de.t_animal.ytnoscreensaver.json to .config/chromium/NativeMessagingHosts/
3. Download xscreensaver-keep-alive-ping and put it on your PATH
